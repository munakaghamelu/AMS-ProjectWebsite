        <h2>Project Background</h2>
        <p>
            Phase 1:
            <b>Research</b>
            <br><br> What are the hardware and spatial requirements and limitations of rigging a space with Kinects (or other sensors) that can able a full 3D capture of multiple participants dancing at once? The system should ideally be able to support
            partner-based dancing as well. The system should record data from all angles to produce a fully 3D rendering of participants that can be viewed and played back from any angle (within reason).
            <br><br> Phase 2:
            <b>Algorithmic Comparison</b>
            <br><br>Identify and separate a participant or couple from their competitors. Compare the isolated competitor(s) to the ideal model of their dance and produce a likeness score. Allow judges to actively flag points of interest during a dance.
            <br><br>Phase 1 covered the core of the requirements of the client, with Phase 2 being the extension goals to attempt once the Phase 1 requirements were met.
        </p>

        <h2>Requirement Gathering</h2>
        <p>Initially, we gathered requirements by reading the the project sheet. We then went on to arrange meetings with the client, and even speaking to our peers that do ballroom dancing to see what would useful features the prototype could have. We then
            created persona's as a result.
        </p>

        <p>The requirements of the project changed over the course of the term. At first, the brief was that the 3D model playback would be used in order to help the judges of dance competitions make fair and reliable decisions. Consequently, the model creation
            would need to be in real time as the dance was going on, as the judges are expected to make quick decisions after the conclusion of any dance. Ultimately, the purpose of our prototype changed to be more educational. Rather than being for the
            judges of dance competitions, it would be a way of recording dancers from multiple angles so that their dance can be played back to them and analysed for errors/areas of improvement. This removes the complexity of real time application.

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Produce a usable system that is helpful in some way to Arthur Murray Dance Studios</li>
            <li> Finished Project must be aesthetically pleasing</li>
            <li> Must be evidence that multiple Kinects have been utilised and ability to merge the data together</li>
            <li> User must be able to play past dances and watch them within the application</li>
            <li> A realistic 3D model of a dancer should be a main feature of the project</li>

        <h1>Team 1: AMS Dance Competition (Phase 1)</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p> The problem statement was to identify the hardware and spatial requirements and limitations rigging a space with suitable sensors. With the goal of creating a fully 3D rendering of multiple participants dancing at once and will support playback
            from every angle. The system should be fair and reliable, and ideally support partner based dancing.
            <br/><br/> Our solution is a Web Application, made with Unity, that takes skeletal data recorded using a Kinect v2 depth sensor and produces a 3D rendering that can be viewed and played back from multiple angles.
            <br/><br/> The achievement and impact of our project is that we have created a system that can be used as a basis for further research into accurately capturing skeletal data from sensors in real time, to then develop more complex algorithms
            for say skeletal comparison.
